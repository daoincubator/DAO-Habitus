# DAOhabitus

## Proposal: DAOhabitus - Git Based Governance

Governance is messy, Git is neat. So lets use it for that!

**Why?** See _"_[_Why Git_](https://parrachia.gitbook.io/dao-habitus/#why-git)_"_ below.

**What?** Structured Governance in 2 [Environments](decision-making/signaling.md#environments) + a [kanban](https://trello.com/b/XrAjqdlO/dao-incubator), somehow.  
\* Staging \(here\) - unlisted with all the messy but stable stuff  
\* [Production](https://dao-incubator.gitbook.io/wiki/) - public with polished and up-to-date documentation  
_Both as Gitbook spaces \(synced with Github repositories\)_

**How?** Honestly I have no clue.

## Governance

We can conceive of many ways to establish the legitimacy of decisions. In some contexts, voting can play a critical role. In others, it’s not needed.[\*](https://www.tonysheng.com/voting-governance)

Governance can be considered: "The process by which we attempt to establish \(and maintain/revoke\) the legitimacy of decisions, decision making processes, and related governance norms/expectations."

#### DAO Habitus is about designing our governance around Git's main traits:

* Distributed
* Collaboration driven
* Community oriented
* Safe environment to work in
* Fast and Agile

## Habitus

The way polity becomes deposited in persons in the form of lasting dispositions, or trained capacities and structured propensities to think, feel and act in determinant ways, which then guide them. Created through a social, rather than individual process, leading to patterns that are enduring and transferable from one context to another, but that also shift in relation to specific contexts and over time. Habitus is not fixed or permanent, and can be changed under unexpected situations or over a long historical period.

[Bourdieu sees power as culturally and symbolically created](https://www.powercube.net/other-forms-of-power/bourdieu-and-habitus/), and constantly re-legitimized through an interplay of agency and structure. The main way this happens is through what he calls ‘habitus’ or socialized norms or tendencies that guide behavior and thinking. _\(Wacquant 2005: 316, cited in Navarro 2006: 16\)._

\[...\] [a theory of structure](https://mens-wisdom-now.blogspot.com/2012/09/structuring-structures-and-structured.html) as both **STRUCTURED** \(opus operatum, and thus open to objectification\) and **STRUCTURING** \(modus operandi, and thus generative of thought and action\).

> “When you feel connected to everything, you also feel responsible for everything. And you cannot turn away. Our destiny is bound with the destinies of others. We must either learn to carry on with the Universe or be crushed by it. We must grow strong enough to love the world, yet empty enough to sit down at the same table with its worst horrors.”

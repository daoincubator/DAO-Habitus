# Accountability

The point of accountability questions is to help a team to maintain the practice of self-organization, after all the glamorous and fun work around role definition has subsided. It’s our solution to a hard problem: _how do you maintain energy and direction around self-organization, once you’ve kick started things with role definitions?_

Accountability questions are useful if you have:

* A list of roles that describe the work your team does
* A well-defined purpose and set of accountabilities for each role
* One person to be accountable to each role
* A time to meet regularly to ask each other your accountability questions

The point of accountability questions is to help a team to maintain the practice of self-management, after all the glamorous and fun work around role definition has subsided. It’s our solution to a hard problem: _how do you maintain energy and direction around self-management, once you’ve kick started things with a role definition workshop?_

## Soft Accountability

Some gotta know what's going on, somehow.

Another actor actively checks in and follows up to help report/share/signal when necessary.

## Hard Accountability

Example:

* **Role title**: Solution specialist
* **Role purpose**: Take known client problems and generate valuable solutions
* **Role accountabilities:** \* Understand when a client problem is fully defined and ready to be solved \* Help solution brainstorms to be creative  \* Prioritize different solution options \* Form and check hypotheses to validate work that we’re doing \* implement solutions

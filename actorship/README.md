# Actorship

{% hint style="info" %}
I took the liberty to name our "ecosystem participants" as ~actors~ because not everybody is truly an agent \(i.e. posses agency\), there is performance included, and in the agnostic place we're carving for ourselves there is a pretty good chunk of acting - according to each project's "grammars"...  
So what defines a "participant" is their "actorship".

## Team &gt; Collaborator &gt; Community

### Community

> _Community is about ownership — feeling not just that I am part of something bigger than myself, but that I have some skin in the game. It doesn’t matter so much whether that stake is economic or not — in fact I think non-economic stake \(e.g. reputation\) can be a much bigger motivator. — Lane Rettig, Independent Ethereum Core Developer \(_[_source_](https://twitter.com/lrettig/status/1037685148681216000)_\)_
